## Why Health Insurance Matters

You might wonder about the importance of health insurance, especially if you're generally healthy. However, there are several compelling reasons to have health insurance:

1. **Unforeseen Events**: Health insurance is designed to prepare you for unexpected life events, such as accidents or illnesses.

2. **Financial Security**: Without health insurance, you may have to bear the burden of medical expenses on your own, which can be quite costly.

3. **Preventive Care**: Health insurance ensures you have access to essential preventive care, often covered at 100%. Regular visits to healthcare providers can contribute to your long-term well-being.

## Key Factors

The cost of health insurance is influenced by several key factors:

1. **Age**: The age of the primary beneficiary.
2. **Gender**: The gender of the primary beneficiary.
3. **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: An indicator of health, with an ideal range between 18.5 to 24.9.
4. **Number of Children**: The number of children covered by the health insurance or dependents.
5. **Smoking Habits**: Whether the beneficiary is a smoker.
6. **Region**: The residential area of the beneficiary in the US (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest).
